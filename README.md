## Actual Status

:white_check_mark: ***Working!*** Alpha 0.04 (2024-10-17 @ 13:38)

***

### Current features

Sprites working for character animations: walking, idle and jumping; Background loads, aswell as physics for the entire project; basic camera system; basic score system; life counter, aswell as world invisible floor and walls to avoid the character to fall off the screen. Follower and coins are also implemented.

***

### Current bugs

Character animations are still too fast, for example, walking animation feels fast, aswell as the idle animation (first frame is the character with open eyes, and second frame is the 
character with closed eyes) resulting annoying. Jump animation may just be seen by a single frame and then it is overridden by the walking animation.

***

### Current changes respecting to model

* Model changes from a cat to Rock Man
* Background changed from a forest to a city.
* The character is now able to jump with an specific sprite for the animation (may need to implement more so it loops).
* Map is relatively smaller. 
* Changed follower and coins model.
