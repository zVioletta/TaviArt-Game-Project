# TaviArt-Game-Project
Helping TaviArt on her basic game. 

## I DO NOT own any of the assets nor the project itself, i've only been working on this project due comission.
### Coding: zVioletta
### Art: Multiple sources
### Project: TaviArt

Actual Status: Alpha 0.03 (2024-10-17@02:20)
Current Features: Sprites actually working for character animations as walking, idle and jumping (this last one i'm not quite sure it actually works well...); Background loading, aswell as physics for the entire project; basic camera system; basic score system; life counter (may need to be moved to another place), aswell as world invisible floor and walls to avoid the character to fall off the screen.
Current Bugs: Character animations may be a little too fast, for example, walking animation feels too fast, the idle animation (first frame is the character with open eyes, and second frame is the character with closed eyes) is too fast, resulting annoying. Jump animation may just be seen by a single frame and then it is overridden by the walking animation.
